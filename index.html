<h2>Lesson 1: Angles</h2>
	<p>An angle is the measure of the space between two lines that intersect. This measurement is in degrees.
	   The measurement of the angle helps to distinguish which type of angle we are dealing with.</p>
	<div id="angle"></div>
	<ul>
		<li>Acute: the angle is less than 90 degrees.</li>
		<li>Right: the angle is exactly 90 degrees.</li>
		<li>Obtuse: the angle is greater than 90 degrees.</li>	
	</ul><br>
	<div id="acute"></div>
	<strong>Practice Problem:</strong>Which of the following angles is pictured above?<br>
	<form method="post" action="https://formspree.io/brennanpolich@gmail.com">		
		<input type="radio" name="answer" id="ansAcute" value="Acute">Acute angle<br>
		<input type="radio" name="answer" id="ansRight" value="Right">Right angle<br>
		<input type="radio" name="answer" id="ansObtuse" value="Obtuse">Obtuse angle<br>
		<input type="submit" value="Submit">

<h2>Pythagorean Theorem</h2>
	<p>The pythagorean theorem refers to a formula that helps describe how the sides of a right triangle 
	   relate to one another. Most of the instances in basic geometry find you determining the length of the hypotenuse
	   of the triangle. For this, you use the pythagorean theorem.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Pythagorean Theorem: a^2 + b^2 = c^2</li>
		<li>For solving the length of a hypotenuse (or c), you would rearrange the formula to be:</li>
		<li>c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)</li>
	</ul>	
	<div id="pythagorean"></div>
	<strong>Practice Problem:</strong>What is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with other sides of lengths 3 and 4?<br>Answer:

<h2>Lesson 3: Area vs. Perimeter</h2>
	<div id="avp"></div>
	<p>Area and perimeter are two of the prominent measurements in geometry. They are also easy to get confused,
	   so it is important to learn the difference between them and how to compute each.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Area: the measurement of the space within a two-dimensional figure. For simplicity, we will look at
		    a rectangle. The area of a recangle is measured by multiplying the height by the width.</li>
		<li>Ex) A rectangle with a width of 20 and a height of 10 has an area of 10 x 20 = 200.</li>
		<li>Perimeter: the measurement of the length of the boundary of a two-dimensional figure. Again, we will
		    use  the rectangle as a basic example. The perimeter of a rectangle is 2 x height + 2 x width.</li>
		<li>Ex) A rectangle with a width of 20 and a height of 10 has a perimeter of 2 x 20 + 2 x 10 = 60.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<strong>Practice Problem:</strong>What is the area and perimeter of a rectangle with width 15 and length 10?<br>
	<form method="post" action="https://formspree.io/brennanpolich@gmail.com">	
		Area:<input type="text" name="answer" id="answer"><br>
		Perimeter:<input type="text" name="answer" id="answer"><br>
		<input type="submit" value="Submit">
	</form>
	
	
<h2>Lesson 4: Volume vs Surface Area</h2>
	<p>Much like area and perimeter, volume and surface area are easily confused for students just starting in geometry.
	   It is important to differentiate the two and memorize the formula for each.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Volume: the measurement of the space within a three-dimensional figure. For our basic example, we will use a
		    rectangular box. The volume of a rectangular box is length x width x height.</li>
		<li>Ex) A rectangular box with a width of 20, a length of 20, and a height of 10 has a volume of 20 x 20 x 10 = 4000.</li>
		<li>Surface Area: the measurement of the area of the surface of a three-dimensional figure. Using a rectangular box,
		    we can find the surface area by calculating 2(width x length + width x height + height x length).</li>
		<li>Ex) A rectangular box with a width of 20, a length of 20, and a height of 10 has a surface area of
		        2(20 x 20 + 20 x 10 + 10 x 20) = 1600.</li>
	</ul>
	<div id="volsurface"></div>
	<p>In the visual representation of the examples above, you can see the clear difference in calculation.
	   Splitting the three-dimensional figure into many two-dimensional figures also makes it simpler to understand and calculate
	   surface area, as that calculation is the total of the areas of all the faces that make up the three-dimensional figure.</p>
	<strong>Practice Problem:</strong>What is the volume and surface area of a cube with width, length, and height of 6?<br>
	<form method="post" action="https://formspree.io/brennanpolich@gmail.com">
		Volume:<input type="text" name="answer" id="answer"><br>
		Surface Area:<input type="text" name="answer" id="answer"><br>
		<input type="submit" value="Submit">
	</form>
